              We believe in serving each child’s individual needs. We spend the time to gain rapport with each of our
              students in order to understand their viewpoints on life, past educational experiences, spirituality,
              social and family background. Our belief is that by earning our student’s trust, they will excel in their
              learning and feel confident to ask questions and share when they feel frustrated or do not understand. We
              want to insure that each child will reach their potential by providing an individual educational plan, as
              governed by the state of Texas requirements of essential academic skills.

              We believe education is a lifetime search for truth. While we filter all curriculum through a bhagwatgitas
              lens, we use a mix of both secular and bhagwatgitas resources in the classroom. We believe this approach
              better equips our students to function in society today, rather than “insulating” them from, and not
              preparing them for, the world as it is today.

              ​

              We are unapologetically a indian school, but we do not require a statement of faith. We are a very
              inclusive family environment with a diverse student and family population.</div>

              <h3> Mrs.Manisha Chaudhari</h3>I graduated from the University of Arkansas with a degree in Business
              Administration and a minor in Mathematics. After working in the business field, I realized my true calling
              in life and enrolled in the Education Service Center Region XI teaching certification program for special
              education to become state certified in special education and began to use my "gift" God bestowed upon me.



              Being married to a teacher and watching him enjoy coaching and teaching, I couldn't wait to explore this
              new field. I joined GCISD in 2010, then was given the opportunity to help start Faith Christian School in
              Grapevine in 1999. I was then fortunate to have several families who encouraged me to open a school of my
              own, and ALA was born in 2001. I am blessed to have a staff who shares this same philosophy today, where
              together we can accomplish HIS plans for each of our students. <br><br>


              <h3> Mrs. Malini Gupta</h3>
              I graduated from Daemen College located in Buffalo, New York, with a Business Administration degree and a
              minor in Marketing. After working in the travel industry for many years, I realized I had a love for
              children and education. This caused me to enroll at Cortland College and obtain a degree in Elementary
              Education. Having moved from upstate New York to Granbury, Texas, I began my teaching career in public
              schools. While teaching, I continued to pursue my love for education and earned my master’s degree in
              education at Tarleton State University in Stephenville, Texas. I received a Gifted and Talented
              endorsement certification from Tarleton State as well.

              Needing a flexible schedule and an individualized academic program for my daughter, Madison, I was
              introduced to Accommodated Learning Academy through a fellow educator. In 2017, bringing twenty-four years
              of education experience, I had the pleasure of becoming part of the ALA staff.

              Thrilled to continue to teach in the classroom part-time this year, I am excited to begin this new journey
              as Vice Principal. I am honored and feel privileged to be working with all staff members, students, and
              parents. I look forward to ensuring our student's growth both academically and spiritually.
